# Introduction

<!-- TODO: Write proper introduction and SDK overview. -->

The Android SDK enables you to build any type of chat or messaging experience for Android. It consists of 3 major components:
* [Client](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/tree/main/stream-chat-android-client): The client handles all API calls and receives events.
* [Offline](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/tree/main/stream-chat-android-offline): The offline lib stores the data, implements optimistic UI updates, handles network failures, and exposes LiveData or StateFlow objects that make it easy to build your own UI on top of.
* [UI](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/tree/main/stream-chat-android-ui-components): The UI package includes view models and custom views for common things like a channel list, message list, message input, etc.
