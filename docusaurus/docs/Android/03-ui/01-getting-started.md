# Getting Started

<!-- TODO: General description of what the UI Components do, how they build on other packages, the sample app, how each View has its own ViewModel and bindView method, etc. -->

### Customization

The SDK provides two entry points for global customization:
- The [`ChatUI` object](./03-chatui.md) to override such things as fonts, URL signing logic, etc.
- The [`TransformStyle` object](./02-global-styling.md) to override view attributes programmatically.
